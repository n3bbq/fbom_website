Our purpose is to further the exchange of information and cooperation between members, to promote radio knowledge, fraternalism and individual operating efficiency, and to so conduct club programs and activities as to advance the general interest and welfare of Amateur Radio in the community. An important objective of FBOM is to extend community knowledge of all digital modes across all bands and to appeal to non retirement age operators.

Membership shall be open to any person who actively supports FBOMâ€™s purpose as set forth in this document. We reserve the right to decline membership to anyone the board deems to not represent the goals and mission of this organization.
